  <h2 style="color:rgb(4, 66, 75);">About me</h2>
  <p style="text-align:justify;">Growing up in a rural district of Tamil Nadu, my journey from a small village to the world of academia has 
    been shaped by dedicated teachers, inspiring college professors, and a supportive Ph.D. supervisor. My passion 
    for engineering ignited in the 8th grade and has been complemented by an inherent love for teaching and sharing knowledge.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">For the past 16 years, I have been immersed in the world of education, teaching core computer engineering courses such as 
    data structures, sequential and parallel algorithms, operating systems, database systems, and computer networks. Among these, 
    my courses on machine learning and neural networks for deep learning hold a special place, reflecting the forefront of technological 
    advancement and my dedication to staying current in these rapidly evolving fields.</p> 

  <p style="text-align:justify;">I firmly believe in the mantra: "Let teaching be your passion and sharing of knowledge be your motto." This philosophy has guided my 
     career, driving me to inspire and mentor the next generation of engineers.</p> 

  <p style="text-align:justify;">Despite two decades of continuous learning and teaching, my thirst for knowledge remains unquenched. I am keen to embark on a post-doctoral 
    journey at a renowned university in the UK or USA, further honing my expertise and contributing to the academic community. I look forward to 
    updating this space with news of that achievement soon.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">A particularly remarkable achievement in my career is my ongoing project funded by LAM Research, worth $50,000. The project, titled 
    "Blockchain-enabled Forecasting and Optimization Framework for Supply Chain Capacity Planning using AI," is one of only 20 proposals 
    selected across the globe. This innovative work aims to leverage blockchain and AI to revolutionize supply chain capacity planning, 
    showcasing my commitment to cutting-edge research.</p>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(4, 66, 75);"> Ph.D. Research</h2>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">My Ph.D. research focused on developing enhanced review rating prediction methodologies that effectively 
    transform text reviews—an abundant and expressive source of insights—into precise ratings. These predicted 
    ratings are subsequently integrated into traditional collaborative filtering, machine learning (ML), and deep 
    learning (DL) algorithms to generate accurate recommendations. This innovative approach aims to bridge the gap 
    between qualitative review content and quantitative rating systems, ultimately improving recommendation accuracy 
    and user satisfaction.</p>

  <h2 style="color:rgb(4, 66, 75);">Abstract of My Ph.D. Dissertation</h2>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The rise of E-commerce and Social networks during the last few decades has made Recommender 
    System (RS) an essential one in our day-to-day life. The conventional "Word-of-Mouth Recommendations" are getting 
    replaced by reviews and ratings given by users. According to ReviewTrackers online survey (2018), more than 90% of 
    the users are going through online reviews before making a purchase decision. The insights present in reviews would 
    help users make personal purchase decisions, track the product quality, and understand the public's opinion.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">There are hundreds of review websites available online and thousands of reviews written for 
    every product. Owing to this voluminous nature of reviews, identifying appropriate reviews is a challenging task for users.
     Furthermore, for certain domains, like restaurants, reviews may not be accompanied by overall ratings. Therefore, 
     identifying informative/insightful reviews from a huge pile is necessary. A straightforward way of doing this is to 
     understand the sentiment polarity of reviews. But, it is difficult to choose one single product from a set of products 
     which are said to have positive polarity. According to the aforementioned survey, 70% of the customers say that they 
     use ratings to filter out low-quality products in their product searches. Hence, a more granular measure of reviews 
     which helps users infer better opinions is numeric ratings. </p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The review rating prediction problem can be approached in two different ways, namely, 
    review content analysis and Collaborative Filetring (CF). The former one uses the Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
    principles together with a Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) model to turn reviews into ratings. The latter 
    one uses CF algorithms to predict the missing ratings in User-Item (UI) matrix. Four different review rating prediction 
    approaches which exploit the aforesaid ways, namely Credible User Review Incorporated Collaborative Filtering (CURICF), 
    Sentiment Enriched and Latent Dirichlet Allocation based review rating Prediction (SELDAP), Deep Learning based and 
    Sentiment enriched Rating (DLSR) prediction, and Class Imbalance Aware Review (CIAR) rating prediction are proposed 
    in this research.</p>   

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The CURICF is a hybrid rating prediction approach that tries to predict the missing 
    ratings in UI matrix by employing user-based CF and the useful insights present in the credible reviews. To gauge 
    the credibility of a review, three factors such as the reputation of the reviewer, content quality, and the number 
    of helpful votes received by the review are utilized.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The SELDAP approach effectively capitalizes the insights present in reviews and the power 
    of ML techniques. This approach treats the rating prediction task as a regression problem. The latent topics that 
    describe the review texts and lexicon-based sentiment scores calculated from those reviews are together used for 
    training a ML regression model. The back propagation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to find the topic 
    distribution and Valence-Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoning (VADER) is used to infer the sentiment scores.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The DLSR approach treats the rating prediction as a multi-class classification problem. 
    An empirical review of feature extraction techniques such as, LDA and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), and 
    Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is carried out in this work to examine their relative prediction 
    performances. For the sake of empowering the rating prediction task with DL techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
    form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is used to train the prediction model and in turn to predict the ratings.</p>

  <p style="text-align:justify;">The CIAR approach tries to reduce the effect of class imbalance issue on review rating 
    prediction task by incorporating appropriate re-sampling techniques and ensemble structures. The combination of random 
    Under-sampling of the majority class and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) based Over-sampling of 
    minority classes is used in CIAR to create balanced datasets. The integration of Bagging and Boosting is used in 
    predicting the ratings corresponding to reviews. </p>    

  <p style="text-align:justify;">For experimental works, Amazon products dataset, Yelp restaurant dataset, and Coursera's 
    course review dataset are used. The performances of the proposed approaches are compared with certain state-of-the-art 
    techniques. The experimental results show that the proposed works outperform the baselines with respect to various 
    aspects.</p>
